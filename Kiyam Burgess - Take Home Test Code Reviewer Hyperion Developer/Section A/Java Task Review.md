Positive Aspects Of The Submission:

You have successfully reversed the string!

Aspects Of The Submission That Could Be Improved:

You have unfortuntately made a few minor errors preventing your code from running correctly.
In line 28: The reverseString method used is supposed to be reverse_string. You must stay consistant with your naming scheme and remember the names you have given your methods, variables and objects.

In line 32: The maxNumber variable is a duplicate variable meaning you have already used a variable with this name. You need to remember the variable names you've used to prevent such an error.

Line 38 to 46: The for loop must be indented further into the static method.

You have not completed the entirety of the project. Your for loop for the first n Fibonacci numbers is not running because the method has not been called.

Overall Feedback:

Your style is good but you have net yet completed the task. Take note of the errors I've highlighted and try again.
